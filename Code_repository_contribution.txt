We have decided to share this line of code that represents login verification.
Every time the user will attempt to enter a page without being logged in, this
will redirect them to the login every time. The reason why we decided to share this,
is because from the code we did the peer review on didn't have any way to verify that
user is logged in. Utilizing this, it is asumed you are also using sessionStorage
to be able to save that you are logged in.

This is the code that verifies that you are logged in. If you are not, it
will send you to login page:

if (!isLoggedIn) {
    window.location.href = "login.html"; 
}


It's expected for you to already implement:

Activate isLoggedIn variable:

var isLoggedIn = sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggedIn');

When you log in successfully, this should be used to save that you are signed in:

localStorage.setItem("isLoggedIn", "true");


Once you log out, this should be added to remove isLoggedIn:

localStorage.removeItem("isLoggedIn");
